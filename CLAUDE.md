## Privacy Rules

- Never expose personal information (email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses) in plain text in HTML or source code.
- Always obfuscate emails using JavaScript-based construction (e.g., splitting into parts assembled on click) so bots cannot scrape them.
- Avoid hardcoding any personally identifiable information (PII) directly in markup, templates, or config files that are publicly served.
